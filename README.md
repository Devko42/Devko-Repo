# Devko-Repo 🚀

This repository contains my first steps in **Python programming**.  
I’m using **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** to practice version control and build the habit of coding every day.  

## 📂 Contents
- `00_hello.py` → My first "Hello World" in Python.  
- `01_variables.py` → Basic variables and data types.  
- `02_operator.py` → Operators in Python.  
- `03_strings.py` → Working with strings.  
- `04_list.py` → Lists and their basic operations.  
- `05_tuples.py` → Tuples in Python.  
- `Jueguillo.py` → A small Python game project.  
- `Snake.py` → Snake game (work in progress 🐍).  

## 🎯 Goal
The main goal of this repository is to **track my learning process** in Python, starting from the basics and moving towards more advanced projects.  

## 🛠️ Tools
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  

## 🌱 Next Steps
- Keep uploading new exercises and small projects.  
- Improve code documentation and structure.  
- Build a portfolio with creative projects that demonstrate my skills.
